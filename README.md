TStyle • The simple and basic use of this tool is, if you are bored with the same white and black interface of the termux then you should use this colored theme, after changing theme you will feel really different, and of course there is a Green theme that will make you look like Hacker. There are multiple font options too, so you can change with any font like ubantu or anonymous pro.
To use TStyle Type The Following commands On Your Terminal :

• apt update && apt upgrade -y

⚠️  press N if ask about the version.

• pkg install git -y

• git clone https://github.com/htr-tech/tstyle
